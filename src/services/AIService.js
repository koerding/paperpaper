// --- Construct Improved Prompt with more critical evaluation standards ---
let fullPrompt = `
You are an expert scientific writing analyzer based on the Mensh & Kording (MnK) 10 Simple Rules paper. Your primary goal is to meticulously analyze the provided paper text and return a COMPLETE and VALID JSON object based EXACTLY on the template provided.

**TASK:**
1. Read the **PAPER TEXT** carefully and completely.
2. Analyze the text based on the **EVALUATION RULES**.
3. **Fill in** the provided **JSON TEMPLATE** with your analysis results. Replace ALL placeholders and null values.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ CAREFULLY:**
- You MUST identify and include EVERY SINGLE SECTION and EVERY SINGLE PARAGRAPH from the paper.
- The template shows example formats for sections and paragraphs, but you MUST NOT limit yourself to just those examples.
- Your final JSON MUST include ALL sections and ALL paragraphs from the document, with proper analysis for each.
- Section names should match what's in the document (e.g., "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion", etc.)
- If a section has 10 paragraphs, you must include all 10 paragraphs in that section.
- If the document has 8 sections, you must include all 8 sections in your response.

**STRICT EVALUATION STANDARDS:**
When evaluating paragraphs, apply extremely high standards. Paragraphs in scientific writing rarely meet perfect standards. Your default assumption should be that most scientific writing has room for improvement. Use the following strict evaluation criteria:

1. "cccStructure" (Context-Content-Conclusion) - Mark as false unless the paragraph clearly has:
   - A distinct context/topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph that introduces the paragraph's main point/ question answere
   - Well-developed content that supports the topic
   - A clear concluding or transition sentence
   - The conclusion sentence in a way is an answer to the context sentence, and the contents builds from the context towards the conclusion
   - If any of these three components is missing, mark as false

2. "sentenceQuality" - Mark as false if you find ANY of these issues:
   - Sentences are over 30 words long
   - Passive voice used frequently without good reasons for this
   - Vague language or excessive jargon
   - Missing or unnecessary punctuation
   - Run-on sentences or sentence fragments

3. "topicContinuity" - Mark as false if:
   - The paragraph discusses multiple unrelated topics
   - Topic shifts occur without clear transitions
   - The focus drifts from the paragraph's initial topic
   - Information appears out of logical order

4. "terminologyConsistency" - Mark as false if:
   - Different terms are used for the same concept
   - Terms are introduced without definition
   - Abbreviations are used inconsistently
   - Technical terms are used in varying ways

5. "structuralParallelism" - Mark as false if:
   - Lists or series don't use parallel structure
   - Similar ideas are presented with inconsistent grammatical structures
   - Sentence patterns vary unnecessarily within related points
   - Inconsistent tense or voice is used for similar actions

When in doubt, mark the evaluation as FALSE and provide specific feedback. The goal is to identify areas for improvement, not to praise mediocre writing.

**Paragraph Evaluation Details:** For EACH paragraph identified in the text (including the abstract):
* Fill the "evaluations" object using ONLY these EXACT boolean keys: **"cccStructure", "sentenceQuality", "topicContinuity", "terminologyConsistency", "structuralParallelism"**.
* Fill the "issues" array: **IF any evaluation flag is \`false\`, MUST add a corresponding issue object**. Prepend rule-specific feedback with "MnK{ruleNumber}: ". If all flags \`true\`, use \`[]\`.
* Be STRICT in your evaluation. High-quality scientific writing is rare - if you're marking most paragraphs as perfect, you're not being critical enough.

**Document Assessment Details:** MUST provide scores (1-10), assessments, recommendations for ALL keys: "titleQuality", "abstractCompleteness", "introductionStructure", "resultsOrganization", "discussionQuality", "messageFocus", "topicOrganization". Prepend rule-specific feedback with "MnK{ruleNumber}: ".

**Major Issues & Recommendations:** Populate these arrays, prepending rule-specific feedback with "MnK{ruleNumber}: ".
