    "content": "Evaluate each of these paragraphs from the \"The estimated connectivity field does attempt to draw causal insights from correlations\" section according to these paragraph-level rules:\n\nRule 2B: Manage cognitive load for your readers\nThe vast knowledge base of human psychology is useful in paper writing. For example, people have working memory constraints in that they can only remember a small number of items and are better at remembering the beginning and the end of a list than the middle. Do your best to minimize the number of loose threads that the reader has to keep in mind at any one time.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Average sentence length is under 25 words, with no sentence exceeding 40 words\n- Sentences have a Flesch-Kincaid readability score appropriate for scientific literature (Grade 12-16)\n- No more than 2-3 new technical concepts are introduced per paragraph\n- Logical structures (if-then, cause-effect) are not nested more than two levels deep\n- Paragraphs are limited to 4-6 sentences, focusing on a single idea or step\n\n\nRule 3B: Apply context-content-conclusion structure at the paragraph level\nThe C-C-C scheme defines the structure of the paper on multiple scales. Applying C-C-C at the paragraph scale, the first sentence defines the topic or context, the body hosts the novel content put forth for the reader's consideration, and the last sentence provides the conclusion to be remembered. Deviating from the C-C-C structure often leads to papers that are hard to read, but writers often do so because of their own autobiographical context. During our everyday lives as scientists, we spend a majority of our time producing content and a minority amidst a flurry of other activities. We run experiments, develop the exposition of available literature, and combine thoughts using the magic of human cognition. It is natural to want to record these efforts on paper and structure a paper chronologically. But for our readers, most details of our activities are extraneous. They do not care about the chronological path by which you reached a result; they just care about the ultimate claim and the logic supporting it. Thus, all our work must be reformatted to provide a context that makes our material meaningful and a conclusion that helps the reader to understand and remember it.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- First sentence of each paragraph establishes context or introduces the topic\n- Middle sentences provide evidence, data, or elaboration of the topic\n- Final sentence of each paragraph offers a conclusion or key takeaway\n- Paragraph organization follows logical rather than chronological structure\n- Each paragraph forms a complete thought unit with clear beginning, middle, and end\n\n\nRule 4B: Optimize logical flow using parallelism\nAcross consecutive paragraphs or sentences, parallel messages should be communicated with parallel form. Parallelism makes it easier to read the text because the reader is familiar with the structure. For example, if we have three independent reasons why we prefer one interpretation of a result over another, it is helpful to communicate them with the same syntax so that this syntax becomes transparent to the reader, which allows them to focus on the content. There is nothing wrong with using the same word multiple times in a sentence or paragraph. Resist the temptation to use a different word to refer to the same concept—doing so makes readers wonder if the second word has a slightly different meaning.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Similar concepts are presented using similar grammatical structures and patterns\n- Same terms are used consistently for the same concepts throughout, avoiding synonyms that could suggest different meanings\n- Items in lists or series use parallel grammatical forms (all nouns, all verb phrases, etc.)\n- Sequence of similar points (e.g., arguments, examples, methods) follows consistent structural patterns\n- Similar sections (e.g., experiment descriptions) follow consistent organizational patterns\n\n\nRule 7C: Structure results paragraphs as question-data-answer units\nThe first results paragraph is special in that it typically summarizes the overall approach to the problem outlined in the introduction, along with any key innovative methods that were developed. Most readers do not read the methods, so this paragraph gives them the gist of the methods that were used. Each subsequent paragraph in the results section starts with a sentence or two that set up the question that the paragraph answers, such as the following: 'To verify that there are no artifacts...,' 'What is the test-retest reliability of our measure?,' or 'We next tested whether Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channels was involved.' The middle of the paragraph presents data and logic that pertain to the question, and the paragraph ends with a sentence that answers the question. For example, it may conclude that none of the potential artifacts were detected. This structure makes it easy for experienced readers to fact-check a paper. Each paragraph convinces the reader of the answer given in its last sentence. This makes it easy to find the paragraph in which a suspicious conclusion is drawn and to check the logic of that paragraph. The result of each paragraph is a logical statement, and paragraphs farther down in the text rely on the logical conclusions of previous paragraphs, much as theorems are built in mathematical literature.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- First paragraph of results summarizes the approach and key methods needed to understand findings\n- Each results paragraph begins by stating a question or purpose that will be addressed\n- Middle of each paragraph presents relevant data and evidence\n- Each results paragraph ends with a clear statement answering the initial question\n- Later paragraphs build on conclusions established in earlier paragraphs\n- Transitions between paragraphs create a coherent flow of experimental logic\n\n\nFor each paragraph, analyze:\n- Context-Content-Conclusion structure\n- Sentence quality (length under 25 words on average)\n- Topic continuity\n- Terminology consistency\n- Structural parallelism\n\nReturn a JSON object with this structure:\n{\n  \"evaluations\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The original paragraph text\",\n      \"summary\": \"Brief summary of content\",\n      \"evaluations\": {\n        \"cccStructure\": boolean,\n        \"sentenceQuality\": boolean,\n        \"topicContinuity\": boolean,\n        \"terminologyConsistency\": boolean,\n        \"structuralParallelism\": boolean\n      },\n      \"issues\": [\n        {\n          \"issue\": \"Description of issue\",\n          \"severity\": \"critical | major | minor\",\n          \"recommendation\": \"Improvement suggestion\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nPARAGRAPHS:\nPARAGRAPH 1:\nFunctional connectivity research has become a substantial part of neuroscientific literature in recent years [1]. Typically studies uses observational methods to estimate “connectivity” via statistical techniques that aim to infer interactions from continuous valued brain signals [2,3]. The approaches that we call estimated connectivity (eC) in this paper convert measured signals into a statistical estimate of “connectivity.”\n\nPARAGRAPH 2:\nWe argue that the eC field uses language that suggests causality and its results aim to drive downstream research as if it was causality. Terms used to describe its methodology include Granger Causality, functional connectivity (FC), information flow, effective connectivity and dynamic causal models [3]. The field does this despite the fact that other terms such as improvement in predictive power, correlations, conditional correlations, and model comparison can denote more precisely what is actually done. The language effectively redefines causality related terms in the English language. Connectivity implies a connection between two places. Causality implies cause and effect. Flow implies that something moves from one place to another. This set of re-definitions gives rise to the problem that eC approaches are often misunderstood by practicing neuroscientists [4].\n\nPARAGRAPH 3:\nThis misleading redefinition profoundly affects downstream science. Scientists write about connections within the brain minimizing the wiring length along which signals need to travel [5,6], but while the brain may want to minimize wiring length, it pays no price for correlations. They write about stimulation to control the network [7], which requires interactions to be causal. They write about “using causal FC methods to identify network mechanisms underlying cognitive computations in the human brain” [8], which implies that prediction is a sufficient (and not just necessary) criterion to justify causal inferences. They write about mechanistic interference to cure diseases [9], which again requires causality. Or they write about regions that “cause more exchange of causal information” [10]. These examples show how correlations are assumed to indicate causality. Specifically, eC is often discussed as if it did reveal an approximate understanding of causality, and much of it is due to misleading use of words that imply causality in lay English and merely refer to algorithm properties in statistics.\n\nPARAGRAPH 4:\nWe ourselves fell for this interpretation. We wrote in 2008  “ […] [estimated connectivity] methods have become staples of neural data analysis, and have revealed a great deal about the interactions between cortical and subcortical structures.” [11]. We could simply have said that models that use other activities as independent variables are good predictors.  With LFPs it was argued that “[…] the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast.” [12]. For EEG and MEG power coherence analyses, it was advocated that “[…] amplitude correlation is an informative index of the large-scale cortical interactions that mediate cognition.” [13]. For fMRI data, other authors reported “[…] changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that promote learning from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill.” [14]. However, all these approaches only reach level one in Pearl’s hierarchy of causation [15,16] – they describe correlations. While the impossibility of making causal statements in such situations is well known [17,18], the field continues to make them. Indeed, a recent perspective paper by published by leading researchers in the eC field explicitly states that it strives causality, predominantly by refining eC measures [2].\n\nPARAGRAPH 5:\nAlgorithms claiming eC have been used exhaustively when analyzing brain data with the hope of getting at causality. Using a more accurate terminology could help in the interpretation and, clarify that our results remain foremost descriptive: Interregional, or interneural signal correlations captures what most techniques measure.\n\nRespond ONLY with the JSON object."
