    "content": "Evaluate the overall structure and quality of this scientific paper according to these document-level rules:\n\nRule 1: Focus your paper on a central contribution, which you communicate in the title\nYour communication efforts are successful if readers can still describe the main contribution of your paper to their colleagues a year after reading it. Although it is clear that a paper often needs to communicate a number of innovations on the way to its final message, it does not pay to be greedy. Focus on a single message; papers that simultaneously focus on multiple contributions tend to be less convincing about each and are therefore less memorable. The most important element of a paper is the title—think of the ratio of the number of titles you read to the number of papers you read. The title is typically the first element a reader encounters, so its quality determines whether the reader will invest time in reading the abstract. The title not only transmits the paper's central contribution but can also serve as a constant reminder (to you) to focus the text on transmitting that idea. Science is, after all, the abstraction of simple principles from complex data. The title is the ultimate refinement of the paper's contribution. Thinking about the title early—and regularly returning to hone it—can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-to-face with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in 'one contribution' that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Title explicitly contains the main finding or central contribution\n- Abstract presents a single focused message rather than multiple distinct claims\n- Different sections (introduction, results, discussion) consistently support the same central contribution\n- Paper presents at most one primary and 1-2 secondary contributions, all clearly related\n\n\nRule 3A: Apply context-content-conclusion structure at the whole-paper level\nThe vast majority of popular (i.e., memorable and re-tellable) stories have a structure with a discernible beginning, a well-defined body, and an end. The beginning sets up the context for the story, while the body (content) advances the story towards an ending in which the problems find their conclusions. This structure reduces the chance that the reader will wonder 'Why was I told that?' (if the context is missing) or 'So what?' (if the conclusion is missing). There are many ways of telling a story. Mostly, they differ in how well they serve a patient reader versus an impatient one. The impatient reader needs to be engaged quickly; this can be accomplished by presenting the most exciting content first (e.g., as seen in news articles). The C-C-C scheme that we advocate serves a more patient reader who is willing to spend the time to get oriented with the context. A consequent disadvantage of C-C-C is that it may not optimally engage the impatient reader. This disadvantage is mitigated by the fact that the structure of scientific articles, specifically the primacy of the title and abstract, already forces the content to be revealed quickly. Thus, a reader who proceeds to the introduction is likely engaged enough to have the patience to absorb the context. Furthermore, one hazard of excessive 'content first' story structures in science is that you may generate skepticism in the reader because they may be missing an important piece of context that makes your claim more credible. For these reasons, we advocate C-C-C as a 'default' scientific story structure. At the whole-paper scale, the introduction sets the context, the results are the content, and the discussion brings home the conclusion.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Paper has clearly labeled introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections\n- Introduction establishes context before presenting the specific research question\n- Results section focuses on presenting data without extensive interpretation\n- Discussion interprets results and draws conclusions beyond mere restatement of findings\n- Paper progresses from context (introduction) to content (results) to conclusion (discussion)\n\n\nRule 4A: Optimize logical flow by avoiding zig-zag\nOnly the central idea of the paper should be touched upon multiple times. Otherwise, each subject should be covered in only one place in order to minimize the number of subject changes. Related sentences or paragraphs should be strung together rather than interrupted by unrelated material. Ideas that are similar, such as two reasons why we should believe something, should come one immediately after the other.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Each subject or concept is discussed in one consolidated section rather than scattered throughout the paper\n- Related ideas are presented together without unrelated content inserted between them\n- Topic shifts occur only when necessary for logical progression, not exceeding 1-2 major shifts per section\n- Subjects reappear only when intentionally reinforcing the central thesis, not due to disorganization\n- Each section maintains focus on a coherent theme with minimal digression\n\n\nRule 5: Tell a complete story in the abstract\nThe abstract is, for most readers, the only part of the paper that will be read. This means that the abstract must convey the entire message of the paper effectively. To serve this purpose, the abstract's structure is highly conserved. Each of the C-C-C elements is detailed below. The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper's contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with). The content ('Here we') first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results. Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., 'broader significance'). This is particularly true for more 'general' journals with a broad readership. This structure helps you avoid the most common mistake with the abstract, which is to talk about results before the reader is ready to understand them. Good abstracts usually take many iterations of refinement to make sure the results fill the gap like a key fits its lock. The broad-narrow-broad structure allows you to communicate with a wider readership (through breadth) while maintaining the credibility of your claim (which is always based on a finite or narrow set of results).\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Abstract begins with 1-2 sentences establishing broad context before narrowing to specific research gap\n- Abstract explicitly identifies the specific gap or problem the research addresses\n- Abstract contains transition phrase (e.g., 'Here we', 'In this study') before describing methods\n- Results are presented after establishing context and methods, not prematurely\n- Abstract ends with interpretation of results and statement of broader significance\n- Abstract contains all elements (problem, approach, findings, meaning) needed to understand the paper's contribution\n- Abstract provides sufficient detail within journal word limit (typically 200-300 words)\n\n\nRule 6: Communicate why the paper matters in the introduction\nThe introduction highlights the gap that exists in current knowledge or methods and why it is important. This is usually done by a set of progressively more specific paragraphs that culminate in a clear exposition of what is lacking in the literature, followed by a paragraph summarizing what the paper does to fill that gap. As an example of the progression of gaps, a first paragraph may explain why understanding cell differentiation is an important topic and that the field has not yet solved what triggers it (a field gap). A second paragraph may explain what is unknown about the differentiation of a specific cell type, such as astrocytes (a subfield gap). A third may provide clues that a particular gene might drive astrocytic differentiation and then state that this hypothesis is untested (the gap within the subfield that you will fill). The gap statement sets the reader's expectation for what the paper will deliver. The structure of each introduction paragraph (except the last) serves the goal of developing the gap. Each paragraph first orients the reader to the topic (a context sentence or two) and then explains the 'knowns' in the relevant literature (content) before landing on the critical 'unknown' (conclusion) that makes the paper matter at the relevant scale. Along the path, there are often clues given about the mystery behind the gaps; these clues lead to the untested hypothesis or undeveloped method of the paper and give the reader hope that the mystery is solvable. The introduction should not contain a broad literature review beyond the motivation of the paper. This gap-focused structure makes it easy for experienced readers to evaluate the potential importance of a paper—they only need to assess the importance of the claimed gap. The last paragraph of the introduction is special: it compactly summarizes the results, which fill the gap you just established. It differs from the abstract in the following ways: it does not need to present the context (which has just been given), it is somewhat more specific about the results, and it only briefly previews the conclusion of the paper, if at all.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Introduction progresses from broad field context to subfield to specific research question\n- Introduction explicitly states what is unknown or missing in the current literature\n- Introduction explains why filling the identified gap matters to the field\n- Introduction paragraphs progress from established knowledge to unresolved questions\n- Literature review focuses specifically on works relevant to developing the research gap\n- Final introduction paragraph summarizes how the paper addresses the identified gap\n- Opening establishes why the research area is interesting or important to capture reader interest\n\n\nRule 7A: Organize results as a logical sequence supporting the central claim\nThe results section needs to convince the reader that the central claim is supported by data and logic. Every scientific argument has its own particular logical structure, which dictates the sequence in which its elements should be presented. For example, a paper may set up a hypothesis, verify that a method for measurement is valid in the system under study, and then use the measurement to disprove the hypothesis. Alternatively, a paper may set up multiple alternative (and mutually exclusive) hypotheses and then disprove all but one to provide evidence for the remaining interpretation. The fabric of the argument will contain controls and methods where they are needed for the overall logic. In the outlining phase of paper preparation (see Rule 9), sketch out the logical structure of how your results support your claim and convert this into a sequence of declarative statements that become the headers of subsections within the results section. Most journals allow this type of formatting, but if your chosen journal does not, these headers are still useful during the writing phase and can either be adapted to serve as introductory sentences to your paragraphs or deleted before submission. Such a clear progression of logical steps makes the paper easy to follow.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Results are presented in logical order that builds toward the central claim, not chronological order of experiments\n- Results subsection headers make declarative statements about findings rather than merely describing content\n- Each result explicitly connects to the central claim of the paper\n- Experiments that are logical prerequisites for understanding later results are presented first\n- Results tell a coherent scientific story with a clear arc leading to the main conclusion\n- Clear transition statements connect different results and experiments\n\n\nRule 7B: Use figures effectively to support your results\nFigures, their titles, and legends are particularly important because they show the most objective support (data) of the steps that culminate in the paper's claim. Moreover, figures are often viewed by readers who skip directly from the abstract in order to save time. Thus, the title of the figure should communicate the conclusion of the analysis, and the legend should explain how it was done. Figure making is an art unto itself; the Edward Tufte books remain the gold standard for learning this craft. Headers of subsections within the results section (and/or the titles of figures) should be declarative statements that communicate conclusions.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Each figure directly supports specific claims made in the text\n- Figure titles state the conclusion drawn from the data, not just what the figure shows\n- Figure legends include sufficient methodological details to understand how data were obtained\n- All figures are explicitly referenced in the main text with clear indication of what to observe\n- Figures and their legends can be understood without having to refer extensively to the main text\n- Data are presented clearly and honestly, with appropriate scales, error bars, and statistical information\n\n\nRule 8A: Summarize how your results fill the gap\nThe discussion section explains how the results have filled the gap that was identified in the introduction, provides caveats to the interpretation, and describes how the paper advances the field by providing new opportunities. This is typically done by recapitulating the results, discussing the limitations, and then revealing how the central contribution may catalyze future progress. The first discussion paragraph is special in that it generally summarizes the important findings from the results section. Some readers skip over substantial parts of the results, so this paragraph at least gives them the gist of that section.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- First discussion paragraph effectively summarizes key findings and their significance\n- Discussion explicitly refers back to the research gap identified in the introduction\n- Discussion synthesizes multiple results to support the paper's central claim\n- Discussion interprets results beyond mere repetition of what was found\n- Discussion clearly states how the results answer the original research question\n- Discussion explicitly states how the work advances understanding in the field\n\n\nRule 8B: Address the limitations of your work\nEach of the following paragraphs in the discussion section starts by describing an area of weakness or strength of the paper. It then evaluates the strength or weakness by linking it to the relevant literature. Discussion paragraphs often conclude by describing a clever, informal way of perceiving the contribution or by discussing future directions that can extend the contribution. For example, the second through fourth paragraphs may deal with potential weaknesses and with how the literature alleviates concerns or how future experiments can deal with these weaknesses.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Discussion explicitly acknowledges key limitations of the study methods, data, or interpretations\n- Limitations are presented honestly rather than minimized or hidden\n- Limitations are placed in context of related work and existing literature\n- Potential criticisms or alternative interpretations are proactively addressed\n- Limitations receive appropriate attention without undermining main findings\n- Future work is suggested to address identified limitations\n\n\nRule 8C: Explain the broader impact of your work\nThe fifth paragraph may culminate in a description of how the paper moves the field forward. Step by step, the reader thus learns to put the paper's conclusions into the right context. This final discussion typically reveals how the central contribution may catalyze future progress in the field.\n\nEvaluation criteria:\n- Discussion clearly articulates how the work advances the specific field\n- Discussion suggests specific, actionable directions for future research\n- Discussion explains implications beyond the immediate research area\n- Findings are integrated into a broader conceptual or theoretical framework\n- Discussion addresses practical applications or relevance of the findings\n- Discussion ends with a strong, memorable statement about the work's significance\n\n\nPAPER INFORMATION:\nTitle: \"Misleading causal statements in functional connectivity research\"\nAbstract: \"As neuroscientists we want to understand how causal interactions and mechanisms within the brain give rise to perception, cognition, and behavior. It has become popular to estimate interactions from measured activity using statistical techniques that aim to estimate “functional connectivity”, and interpret these correlational estimates in causal terms. However, we argue that any given observed correlation can be explained by an infinite set of causal models that consider the unobserved variables. We show that the omitted variable bias equation makes this relation precise: as we only record low-dimensional signals from high-dimensional brains, the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the few observed ones. We argue that only brain perturbations allow approaching causality.\"\nAbstract Summary: \"The abstract discusses the challenges of interpreting functional connectivity in neuroscience, emphasizing the limitations of correlational estimates due to unobserved variables and advocating for brain perturbations to approach causality.\"\n\nSECTION SUMMARIES:\nSection: The estimated connectivity field does attempt to draw causal insights from correlations\n     Paragraph count: 5\n     Issues found: 3\n     Paragraph summaries:\n       - P1: Introduction to the concept of estimated connectivity in neuroscientific research.\n       - P2: Critique of the language used in the eC field that suggests causality.\n       - P3: Discussion on how misleading language in eC affects scientific interpretations.\n       - P4: Reflection on past misinterpretations and the ongoing issue of causality claims in eC.\n       - P5: Call for more accurate terminology to clarify the descriptive nature of eC results.\n\nSection: Defining causality\n     Paragraph count: 1\n     Issues found: 1\n     Paragraph summaries:\n       - P1: The paragraph discusses the definition of causality in neuroscience, advocating for the counterfactual definition and its application in scientific claims.\n\nSection: Box 1.
