    "text": "As neuroscientists we want to understand how causal interactions and mechanisms within the brain give rise to perception, cognition, and behavior. It has become popular to estimate interactions from measured activity using statistical techniques that aim to estimate “functional connectivity”, and interpret these correlational estimates in causal terms. However, we argue that any given observed correlation can be explained by an infinite set of causal models that consider the unobserved variables. We show that the omitted variable bias equation makes this relation precise: as we only record low-dimensional signals from high-dimensional brains, the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the few observed ones. We argue that only brain perturbations allow approaching causality.",

They write about stimulation to control the network [7], which requires interactions to be causal. They write about “using causal FC methods to identify network mechanisms underlying cognitive computations in the human brain” [8], which implies that prediction is a sufficient (and not just necessary) criterion to justify causal inferences. They write about mechanistic interference to cure diseases [9], which again requires causality. Or they write about regions that “cause more exchange of causal information” [10].

We could simply have said that models that use other activities as independent variables are good predictors.  With LFPs it was argued that “[…] the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast.” [12]. For EEG and MEG power coherence analyses, it was advocated that “[…] amplitude correlation is an informative index of the large-scale cortical interactions that mediate cognition.” [13]. For fMRI data, other authors reported “[…] changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that promote learning from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill.” [14]. However, all these approaches only reach level one in Pearl’s hierarchy of causation [15,16] – they describe correlations. While the impossibility of making causal statements in such situations is well known [17,18], the field continues to make them.

Whenever we refer to causal interactions in this opinion paper, we will use the counterfactual definition. A variable causally influences another variable if a perturbation of the first variable would induce a change in the activity of another variable [15,20]. This approximates what we mean as neuroscientists: if we say a neuron influences another neuron, we mean that perturbing the first (e.g. electrically) would affect the second and if we say that a region influences another, we mean that perturbing the first region (e.g. magnetically) would affect the second. Hence, causality has an intuitively clear definition (counterfactuals or perturbation) and we should demand our statistical approaches to be measured against it (although see also Gomez-Marin, 2017). While there is significant debate about adequate definitions of causality in contemporary philosophical literature [22–25], we argue that neuroscientists by and large use our definition and will underscore this point with the way these scientists make claims in their papers.

The argument is that if the brain’s activity was very low dimensional and aligned with recorded dimensions [55], then recording from a small number of voxels or neurons may be equivalent to recording all of them. Such view assumes that we believe that the composition of the activity within a voxel, for instance, does not matter but just the measured sum of (unobserved) individual activities. We thereby effectively subscribe to a strong mean-field view, which is dominant among eC methodology [56–59]. However, within each voxel, we find neurons of countless tuning properties [60] that describe how neurons are affected by a stimulus dimension such as color. On a theoretical level, it thus becomes clear how mean-field or ensemble averaging techniques fall risk of violating ergodicity principles as a key assumption of cause-effect inference, i.e. that the mean response of representative samples allow predictions about individual members of those samples [61]. On a practical level, model inferences becomes easily biased when algorithms that compute eC based on mean-field variables (e.g. the average activity within several voxels informed by some parcellation) miss relevant nodes [45,51]. Lastly we argue that effectively, mean-field studies set up simulations that unfold in low-dimensional spaces and then show that they can be recovered in low-dimensional spaces, rendering the approach somewhat circular [56–59]. To our knowledge no study has shown that networks that compute like brains can be approximated by the underlying mean-field approximation.

Perturbation techniques such as neurofeedback training and brain computer interfaces (BCIs) may be seen as an approximation to direct perturbations [79], because they allow to entrain correlations between brain regions and test for desired behavioral changes and have thus been advocated as tools for trying to understand causality within the brain [80–82]. BCIs synchronized in multiple users (so called hyperscanning) provide a special use case that allows closed-loop control of neural synchrony. These developments have recently initiated debates about causal inferences that can be drawn from well-controlled BCI experiments [83–86]. As complex interventions BCIs entail various obvious confounders and require experiments with (often many) carefully designed control conditions [87]. Combining BCIs with brain stimulation techniques may circumvent some limitations of other approaches. Further, complementary invasive closed-loop optogenetic stimulation studies conducted in animals, where stimulation is triggered by learned neural activity patterns [88], may circumvent some of the confounders and provide converging evidence [19,89]. Conceptual work is needed, however, to obtain clarity about these interpretations.",

Clinicians ask if interventions affect eC as “biomarkers”. Brain stimulation techniques can thus be “eC-navigated”, i.e. targets are defined based on eC measures that predict (individual) clinical outcomes [90]. Brain Computer interfaces (BCIs) can target eC measures using eC changes as readily optimizable targets [83,91]. eC may be the best quantitative biomarkers for intervention effects when tested in adequately designed randomized controlled trials. They may also enable a quest to understand if low-dimensional organization principles can approximate causality [2]. However, research based on eC biomarkers remain somewhat circular field where changes in low-dimensional space are used to justify low-dimensional assumptions (e.g. mean-field based eC between two brain regions). Thus, causal insight about eC biomarkers (e.g. when used in eC-navigated perturbations) will require converging evidence [19] across organisational levels of the nervous system (i.e. molecular mechanisms) [49] and, above all, tests based on perturbations.",

          "text": "We have reviewed why eC approaches cannot meaningfully get at causality due to massive confounding from unobserved variables – correlations are not causation and omitted variables produce biases. However, this circumstance does not imply that trying to understand the joint dynamics of many neurons or brain areas is not interesting. For example, looking at the brain in lower dimensional projections may allow us to see its invariances [92–94]. Interregional correlations may have no causal meaning, but they may allow us to derive biomarkers [95–97]. To which degree these reflect neuronal interactions, however, remains subject to future perturbational, well controlled studies. Understanding joint statistics of neurons or brain networks is highly informative, however, statements about joint statistics are not meaningful statements about causality – it is important to be clear about the statements permitted by any one approach. In cases where these cannot be substantiated, only descriptive approaches [98] non-causal explanations are informative and meaningful [25,99]. Lastly, we note that there may be also a sociological dimension to the raised issues: authors often seem incited to make causal statements using filler verbs (e.g. to drive, alter, promote) as a form of storytelling [21] to leverage the perceived attractiveness of their work. Instead of committing this fallacy, we encourage researchers to question the causal validity of statements, probe underlying assumptions and test counterfactual inference boundaries (see Outstanding questions).",
